# Unnamed Game Engine (To be named later once completed)

Developed on JDK 17

End Goal: Game Engine Library with fully functional managers, including SceneManager for proper scene handling, graphics for different scene types, simplified flow, and asset handling.

Inspired by Mark Claypool's Dragonfly Engine. Just decided to work with Java not to torture myself.
